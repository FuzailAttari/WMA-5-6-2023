	<h1 > <u> What does devotion require us to do  </u></h1>
        
	<p>
		Devotion to <b> <u> The Holy Prophet  صَلَّى اللّٰەُ عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم </u> </b> requires that his Sunnah be acted upon, his religion be helped and his blessed sayings and actions be followed <br>
         Whatever <strong> he صَلَّى اللّٰەُ عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم has commanded </strong> should be enthusiastically carried out and whatever he صَلَّى اللّٰەُ عَلَيْهِ وَاٰلِهٖ وَسَلَّم has forbidden, should be avoided.
	</p>
    <p>
        Imam Shahabuddin Ahmad Bin Muhammad Qastalani رَحْمَةُ اللّٰەِ عَلَيْه stated: <br>
         The culmination of devotion is that one prefers the wish of his beloved to his own wish    </p>
